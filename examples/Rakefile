# Simple example: reads from a subscription queue, writes the events to STDOUT

# Usage (from this directory):

  # type: One of "tweet" or "delete"
  # event: a hash of the json data from twitter
  def self.perform(type, event)
    # Do stuff with the data, probably something more interesting than this:
    puts [type, event].inspect
