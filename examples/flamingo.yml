# Event logging (optional) 
# Allows you to log the raw JSON of stream events to a set of rotating files 
# stored in the directory you specify. Size is the maximum number of events 
# that will be written to a log file before it is rotated. If size is omitted 
# no rotation will be done. If you expect a high volume stream, set this number 
# to something relatively large or you will end up with lots of small log files.
# 10000-100000 is probably a good place to start.
